### CardSense

**CardSense** is an AI-powered tool designed to help credit card salespeople deliver a data-driven, personalized pitch during a sales call. This application compares the features of a card being sold with a card a customer already has, generating a clear and concise script to highlight the benefits.

---

### üö® The Problem
Salespeople often lack the tools to quickly and effectively compare credit cards on a call. This can lead to missed opportunities, as they may fail to highlight key features like **lounge access, cashback rates, or insurance coverage** that are most relevant to the customer.

---

### üí° The Solution
CardSense solves this by providing an instant comparison and a tailored sales pitch. By inputting the details of both cards, the application identifies and highlights the superior features of the pitched card, enabling the salesperson to have a **smart, confident, and persuasive conversation.**

### ‚ú® Features
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Visually compare two credit cards based on key features like annual fee, cashback, reward points, credit limit, and special benefits (e.g., lounge access, golf benefits).  
- **AI-Generated Sales Pitch:** Receive a customized script that explains why the pitched card is a better choice for the customer.  
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the generated pitch to use it in a call, email, or message.
